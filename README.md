# Toshi - Your personal shopping assistant powered by Augmented Reality
Toshi is a personal shopping assistant powered by augmented reality that will transform the grocery shopping experience. Toshi was created for Toshiba Retail Challenge 2018. With it our team won the first prize.

## Description
Users can create and share grocery lists on the Toshi web-app at home before shopping. When they arrive in the grocery store, they can then retrieve their consolidated grocery list in-store via the Toshi tablet app and attach the tablet to their shopping cart via a customised tablet holder. Based on the grocery list, Toshi will generate an optimised shopping path through the grocery store by utilizing CSP techniques via machine-learning and guide the shopper through the store via Augmented Reality (AR). While shopping, a shopper can also scan a product barcode, which will call and render a detailed product description via AR on the tablet, giving the shopper the ability to make more informed choices. Brands can also use our AR platform to further engage shoppers through creating interesting AR content. This correspondingly creates business value for Toshiba through the sale of AR ad space. Once the user has finished shopping, Toshi will hinge on Toshiba's Elevate platform to generate a QR code which the cashier can then scan to retrieve the final grocery list, thus simplifying the payment process.
